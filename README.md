# PlantShop_v2.0
## Requirement
> Note that you might also need to change SQL port as well, my setting is port 1433.
* JDK and JRE 1.8
* Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (previous version might work as well).
* Tomcat Server 8.5 (or 9, I don't suggest using 10 or higher).
* For IDE I'm using Netbeans 12.4 (8.2 plugins are no longer supported).
## Installation
> Open `.sql` file in SSMS then use `Ctrl + A` and `F5` to execute.
* In `PlantShop_DB` you will need to run `Database.sql` to install Database.
* `Data.sql` file is my data, you can make your own or use mine.

Update soon...
